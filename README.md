nativesca
=========

Native SCA is an extension for the Tuscany native platform. The difference
between this and the original C++ extension is that instead of imposing the
use of the C++ SCA API on component developers this extension will use
dependency injection. This is made possible by the use of the SelfPortrait
reflection library for C++11
